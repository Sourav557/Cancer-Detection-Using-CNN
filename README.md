# Cancer Detection Using CNN
This project is all about using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to help detect cancer in medical images. The goal is to create a system that can quickly and accurately identify cancerous tissues, making it easier for doctors and medical professionals to diagnose and treat patients.

# What This Project Does
Uses Deep Learning: The core of the project is a CNN model designed specifically for classifying medical images.

Processes Data: The images go through preprocessing steps like resizing, normalizing, and augmenting to make the model more accurate.

Learns from Experts: By using pre-trained models like VGG19, the system gets a head start on learning and performs better with less training time.

Evaluates Performance: The model is tested with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and more to ensure it works well in real-world scenarios.

Tools and Tech Behind the Scenes

Language: Python

Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV

Environment: Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection

# How It Works
Collecting Data: First, a dataset of labeled medical images is gathered. This includes both cancerous and non-cancerous images.
Prepping the Data: The images are cleaned up and transformed to make them ready for training. Think resizing, normalizing, and adding some variations (augmentation).
Building the Model: A CNN architecture is created (or fine-tuned using a pre-trained one) to learn from the data.
Training & Testing: The model is trained on most of the dataset and tested on the rest to see how well it performs.
Testing on New Images: The final step is checking how the model handles completely new images it hasn’t seen before.

# What’s Next?
Here’s how the project could grow:
Add support for more types of cancers and larger datasets.
Use even more advanced deep learning techniques to boost accuracy.
Deploy the model as a web app or API to make it accessible to anyone, anywhere.
Speed things up to allow real-time predictions.
